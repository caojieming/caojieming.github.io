The Odin Project is an online course on web development which (as of writing this) I'm currently studying/learning through.

My Senior Project was also focused on web development. However, that was made mostly through a series of scattered online guides and self-learning, along with a generous amount of assistance from someone who had experience with web development.

The Odin Project is a well-organized curriculum with many smaller projects scattered throughout it. It ensures that anyone following its lessons will have a thorough understanding of what each line of HTML, CSS, and JS does.

As I complete projects throughout the curriculum, I will add links to them here.
